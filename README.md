# handy: phase 1
A web based user sign in log to help keep track of a users projects at home.

Written in Java 8,
Using Spring (Framework), 
Hiebernate ORM (Object Relationship Mapping),
Thymeleaf (Java Template Engine), 
HTML5 (Markup Language for Structuring and Presenting Content on the Web), 
CSS (Styles HTML element),
Bootstrap (CSS Framework),
MAMP (Local Server Environment),
phpMyAdmin (Admin Tool for MySQL) and
IntelliJ IDEA IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Multiple users can sign in and see their own projects in a list or all of the projects, their users and which Workers are assigned to each one.
Passwords are hashed and only stored in their hashed state.
Users can also add people or companies to the Workers list and then assign them projects.
Users creating a project use the 3 input fields: Room/Area that needs the work, Description of the work and the Category of work such as Electrical or Plumbing, etc...
Users can also create the Categories they need if they are not already on the Category list, such as Roofing or Flooring.
Phase 1 is simple, and useful.

Future phases can add a multitude of features such as integrating labor and material bol/costs 
or adding a contractor sign in that allows Workers to select their own projects in stead of being assigned by the user 
or password reset or deletion of any specific area.
These are just some of the possiblities when time allows.
